# AZOT_POKEMON

This project uses React-Native with Expo.

To run it on your device:

- clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:Bopzor/azot_pokemon.git`
- install dependencies (inside `azot_pokemon folder`): `yarn install`
- start expo: `yarn start`

From here, you will be able to run it on your Android or iOS device.

You will see the list of all available pokemons (thank's to [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/)) and could display a specific pokemon name and sprite after selection

Go catch them all!
